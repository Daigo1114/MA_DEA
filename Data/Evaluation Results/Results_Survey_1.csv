For optimal viewing experience, we recommend using a device with a screen resolution larger than 1600x900 pixels. ","5. From the Simulation Control Panel located in the bottom right corner, you can activate the dynamic bar chart by clicking on the  âž¤ button . Select Order ID 'Order 1', and select the GHG type and source you want to see. Try to answer:
Which activity release the most amount of gas over all the time?","6. The dynamic bar chart might show trends of the amount of gases emited over time, which of the following statements is true?",7. How many activities does the business process have? (Exclude the external activities),8. Which visual representations did you use to answer the previous question?,"9. In the business process flow chart, what does the red background in the process diagram indicate?",10. Which activity does not belong to external activities?,11. Please select number 4 on the following graph,"12. Select Order Id  'Order 3', 'ch4' for GHG type, and 'total' for Source on the panel. Try to answer:
Which activity releases the third highest amount of CH4 among all activities (including both main activities and external activities)? ",13. How accurate do you perceive the data displayed in the radial bar chart?,"14.  Select  Order Id  'Order 4' , 'co2' for GHG type, and 'total' for Source on the panel. Try to discover: 
What percentage of the total emissions is released by Activity 4 (Prepare to Send Orders)? ","15.  Select 'Order 4' for Order Id;  'co2' for GHG type;  'total' for Source; and only choose 'delivery' and 'waste' for external activities on the Panel.  Try to answer:
What percentage of the total emissions is released by 'delivery' ?","16. Select GHG type 'n2o' on the filter panel. Compare all the five orders: 
Which activity seems to always release the least greenhouse gas?",17.  Which visual representations did you use to answer the previous question?,"18.  Select 'co2' as GHG Type and select 'equipment' as source of GHG on the panel. Try to disvover: 
What is the average amount of emissions for  Activity 4 (Prepare to Send Orders)  across five orders?"" ",19. How clear and understandable did you find the layout of the visualization panel?  ,20.  How effectively did the filtering options meet your needs in exploring GHG emissions data? ,21. How effectively do the visual elements express the data presented? ,22. How satisfied are you with the speed and responsiveness of the visualization panel?  ,"23. Which of the offered visual representations, in your opinion, is best suited for showing the amount of GHG emissions?","24. Here we presents another visualization, a dynamic flowchart in GIF format that displays Order 1's CO2 emissions across different stages (the GIF lasts approximately 35 seconds). Compared to the dynamic bar chart in the visualization dashboard, do you think the display mode shown here in the survey can help you better understand?","25. Compare the business process flow on the top right corner of the dashboard to the following picture, do you think this display mode can help people with visual issues (e.g. colour deficiency, colour blindness)?","Thank you for your time for the survey, do you have any further comments and suggestions for the improvments of the visualization dashboard? Feel free to answer the question."

The difficulty of the problem is not very high, which is interesting to continue to study but not too difficult, great.
In addition, I think the color of the visual dashboard can be more vivid, and it is more clear to distinguish by different colors. Simple text and graphics will be easier to understand than complex tables."
