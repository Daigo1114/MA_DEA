	abstract = {Purpose
              Business Process Management ({BPM}) is key for successful organisational management. However, {BPM} techniques are often criticized for their inability to deal with continuous and significant change and uncertainty. Following recent calls to make {BPM} more agile and flexible towards change, this study presents the results of a systematic literature review ({SLR}) of agile concepts in {BPM}. Analysing and synthesising previous works and drawing on agility research in the field of {IS}, this paper introduces a framework for agile {BPM}. Integrating different components that define agility in the context of {BPM}, this framework offers a number of important implications. On the theoretical side, the authors argue that the concept of agile {BPM} departs in some important ways from traditional {BPM} research. This, in turn, points to various opportunities for future research. On the practical side, the authors suggest that emerging technologies, such as process mining, embody important features that help organisations to be more responsive to change. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                To assess the state of the art of agility in the {BPM} research, the authors conducted an {SLR}. More specifically, the authors drew on the approach of vom Brocke
                et al.
                (2009, 2015), which consists of five steps: defining the scope of the review; conceptualising the topic; searching for literature; analysing and synthesising literature; and developing a research agenda.
              
            
            
              Findings
              This study presents the results of a systematic review of agile concepts in {BPM}. This study then proposes a resulting research framework that can be used to strengthen the concept of agile {BPM} and provides an agenda for research in this rapidly growing and increasingly necessary area of {BPM}.
            
            
              Originality/value
              In this paper, the authors establish a shared understanding of agile {BPM} and develop an agile {BPM} framework that represents the current state as well as implications for research and practice in agile {BPM}.},

Governments and organizations have been challenged to identify their environmental impacts to address environmental sustainability issues. A promising, yet under-studied in this context, theme of information systems ({IS}) literature that has the potential to help with identifying, quantifying and managing environmental impacts is business process management ({BPM}). With its focus on continual process performance improvement, the capacity of {BPM} to contribute to Environmental Sustainability ({ES}) needs to be further explored. Yet, contributions from the {BPM} research community and the impact of these contributions appear to be fragmented. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review to explore {BPM} contributions to {ES}, with a focus on environmental performance indicators ({EPIs}) as well as relevant organizational factors related to {ES} and {BPM}. In doing so, we identify and explore ‘Green {BPM}’ contributions and suggest ways to advance {BPM} research in the context of {ES}.},

            Entrepreneurship involves identifying and exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities. However, to create the most value entrepreneurial firms also need to act strategically. This calls for an integration of entrepreneurial and strategic thinking. We explore this strategic entrepreneurship in several important organizational domains to include external networks and alliances, resources and organizational learning, innovation and internationalization. The research in this special issue examines both traditional (e.g., contingency theory, strategic fit) and new theory (e.g., cultural entrepreneurship, business model drivers). The research also integrates, extends, and tests theory and research from entrepreneurship and strategic management in new ways such as creative destruction (discontinuities), resource‐based view, organizational learning, network theory, transaction costs and institutional theory. The research presented herein provides a basis for future research on strategic entrepreneurship for wealth creation. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

              Green Business Process Management ({BPM}) focusses on the ecological impact of business processes. Although it is an emerging field, different attitudes exist towards the discipline’s name, the objectives and the approaches to realise them. By means of a systematic literature review, the purpose of this paper is to arrive at a common understanding of the discipline for successful development.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              
                The review methodology relies on a hermeneutic framework which integrates the search, analysis and interpretation of the literature. The sample is used in a text analysis to find an appropriate definition (
                {RQ}1
                ), a bibliometric analysis to give insights in current Green {BPM} contributions (
                {RQ}2
                ) and a content analysis to present differences with conventional {BPM} (
                {RQ}3

              Findings
              Green {BPM} follows a similar development as conventional {BPM}, namely from a more technical perspective to also including the managerial perspective. More research is required that goes beyond the traditional business process lifecycle.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The research questions generated a comprehensive overview about application domains and research topics, which in turn can deliver benefits for both research and practitioner-related communities.

abstract = {Knowledge production within the field of business research is accelerating at a tremendous speed while at the same time remaining fragmented and interdisciplinary. This makes it hard to keep up with state-of-the-art and to be at the forefront of research, as well as to assess the collective evidence in a particular area of business research. This is why the literature review as a research method is more relevant than ever. Traditional literature reviews often lack thoroughness and rigor and are conducted ad hoc, rather than following a specific methodology. Therefore, questions can be raised about the quality and trustworthiness of these types of reviews. This paper discusses literature review as a methodology for conducting research and offers an overview of different types of reviews, as well as some guidelines to how to both conduct and evaluate a literature review paper. It also discusses common pitfalls and how to get literature reviews published.}

	isbn = {978-3-662-43839-8},
	abstract = {This book provides guidelines for practicing design science in the fields of information systems and software engineering research. A design process usually iterates over two activities: first designing an artifact that improves something for stakeholders, and subsequently empirically investigating the performance of that artifact in its context. This "validation in context" is a key feature of the book - since an artifact is designed for a context, it should also be validated in this context. The book is divided into five parts. Part I discusses the fundamental nature of design science and its artifacts, as well as related design research questions and goals. Part II deals with the design cycle, id est the creation, design and validation of artifacts based on requirements and stakeholder goals. To elaborate this further, Part III presents the role of conceptual frameworks and theories in design science. Part IV continues with the empirical cycle to investigate artifacts in context, and presents the different elements of research problem analysis, research setup, and data analysis. Finally, Part V deals with the practical application of the empirical cycle by presenting in detail various research methods, including observational case studies, case-based and sample-based experiments, and technical action research. These main sections are complemented by two generic checklists, one for the design cycle and one for the empirical cycle. The book is written for students as well as academic and industrial researchers in software engineering or information systems. It provides guidelines on how to effectively structure research goals, how to analyze research problems concerning design goals and knowledge questions, how to validate artifact designs, and how to empirically investigate artifacts in context - and finally how to present the results of the design cycle as a whole},
